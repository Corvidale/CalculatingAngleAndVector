For this to work it uses its own class called Vector

the Vector has x and y value and can be accessed with .GetX() and .GetY()
currently i haven't adde .SetX and .SetY, because the program doesn't need it for my purposes

To get the initial angle only use the function: CalculateInitialAngle();      NOTE: it outputs in radiance

To get the initial vector, use the function: VectorFromAngle();     NOTE: it outputs in the Vector class
